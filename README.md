# 🔐 Auth Pro Plus

Production-ready authentication system for SwiftUI apps.  
Built to be modular, scalable, and drop-in ready for real-world applications.

Supports **Supabase** and **Firebase**, with a protocol-oriented architecture that makes integration simple and clean.

---

## 🚀 What Is Auth Pro Plus?

Most authentication tutorials stop at “sign in” and “sign up.”

Auth Pro Plus is a **complete, production-grade authentication system** designed to handle:

- Social auth (Google & Apple Sign In)
- User session and state management
- Error handling
- Username workflows
- Onboarding flows
- App Store requirements
- Reusability across multiple apps

This is the same system reused across production applications.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔑 Authentication Methods
- ✅ Email / Password
- ✅ Google Sign In
- ✅ Sign in with Apple
- 🔜 Phone Authentication (coming in v2)

---

### 🧠 Robust Error Handling API

All authentication methods are backed by a unified error handling layer.

- Centralized error mapping
- Human-readable error messages
- Network & provider-specific handling
- Easy UI integration
- Extensible for custom backend errors

No more scattered `if let error` blocks.

---

### 👤 Account Creation Flow

- Email validation
- Username validation
- Optional step for adding usernames thru social auth flow
- Fully customizable onboarding sequence
- Add or remove steps easily

If your app doesn’t require usernames, you can disable that flow entirely.

---

### 📸 Optional Profile Photo Upload

- Upload during onboarding
- Optional step
- Fully removable if your app doesn’t require profile images

---

### 🧩 Fully Customizable Design Component Library

- Reusable auth UI components (buttons, avatars, loading indicators & text fields)
- Clean SwiftUI architecture
- Easily themeable
- Replace fonts, colors, styles
- Swap entire view layers if needed

Designed to feel native in *your* app.

---

### 🔄 Flexible Onboarding Flow

- Add new steps easily
- Remove steps without breaking flow
- Reorder steps safely
- Supports conditional steps (e.g., only show username if required)

---

### 🏗 Protocol-Oriented Architecture

Auth Pro Plus is built using protocol-oriented programming to make integration simple.

Benefits:

- Swap backend providers (Supabase ↔ Firebase)
- Dependency injection friendly
- Easily testable
- Clean separation of concerns
